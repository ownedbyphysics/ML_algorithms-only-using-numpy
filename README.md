# ðŸ§  Understanding the Fundamentals
Machine Learning from Scratch using NumPy

This repository contains implementations of classic machine learning models, built from the ground up using only NumPy â€” no scikit-learn, no external ML libraries. The goal is to understand the math behind each algorithm, not just use them.
